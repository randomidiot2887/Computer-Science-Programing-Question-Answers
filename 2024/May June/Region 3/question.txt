#the question itself
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A one-dimensional (1D) array Teams[] contains the names of 10 football teams in a local league.
# A two-dimensional (2D) array Results[] stores, for each team, the total number of:
# • games won
# • games drawn
# • games lost
# • points.
# The position of any team’s data is the same in both arrays. For example the data in index 3 of
# Results[] belongs to the team in index 3 of Teams[]
# The array data will be used to find the current leader of the league.
# The variable Played stores the number of games played by each team. Each team plays the
# same number of games.
# Write a program that meets the following requirements:
# • allows the number of games played to be input and stored, with a maximum of 18 games
# • allows the names of the teams to be input and stored
# • allows the number of games won, drawn and lost to be input and stored for each team
# • validates the number of games played and the number of games won, drawn or lost against
# the number of games played
# • calculates and stores the number of points for each team using three points for a win and one
# point for a draw; there are no points for a loss
# • sorts the array Results[] into descending order of number of points, ensuring the
# corresponding parallel array Teams[] is kept in the same order
# • determines how many teams have the highest number of points
# • outputs the name(s) of the winning team(s) along with the number of points achieved.
# You must use pseudocode or program code and add comments to explain how your code works.
# You do not need to declare any arrays, variables or constants; you may assume that this has already been done.
# All inputs and outputs must contain suitable messages.
